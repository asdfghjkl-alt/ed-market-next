        A full-stack e-commerce application built with Next JS and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl sm:mx-5 md:mx-30">
        The project constructs a full shopping website experience featuring
        secure user authentication, an admin dashboard for product, category and
        order management, dynamic cart display, and order processing.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl sm:mx-5 md:mx-30">
        Further, Role Based Access Control has now been fully implemented with
        roles of buyers, sellers and admins with different level of permissions
        for actions.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl sm:mx-5 md:mx-30">
        In the project, buyers can only view products and add them to cart,
        sellers can also create, update and delete their own products, and
        admins can delete any products, manage orders, manage user roles and add
        product categories.
