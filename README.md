Welcome to EdMarket! Your one-stop shop for all your grocery needs.

A full-stack e-commerce application updated to Next.js.

The project constructs a full shopping website experience featuring secure user authentication, an admin dashboard for product, category and order management, dynamic cart display, and order processing. Full RBAC has now been fully implemented with roles of buyers, sellers and admins with different levels of permissions for actions.

This is a holiday project and is still undergoing development.

Deployed to ed-market.vercel.app
